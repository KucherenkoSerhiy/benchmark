# 2. Batch Processing: Async with Batching

**Given**: 
- An application designed to process entries in batches.
- A third-party service that introduces a 200ms delay per entry.
- A benchmark to measure performance characteristics.

## How to Run

1. Launch the third-party service to act as an endpoint.
2. Execute the benchmark to get performance metrics.

## Benchmarks

| Method             | NumEntries |        Mean |    Error |   StdDev |     Gen0  |     Gen1 |     Gen2 | Allocated  |
|--------------------|------------|------------:|---------:|---------:|----------:|---------:|---------:|-----------:|
| ProcessEntriesTest | 1000       |    893.5 ms |   8.47 ms|  10.40 ms|  5000.0000| 3000.0000| 1000.0000|  20.03 MB  |
| ProcessEntriesTest | 10000      |  9,662.7 ms | 192.53 ms| 453.82 ms| 53000.0000|29000.0000|11000.0000| 200.81 MB  |
| ProcessEntriesTest | 20000      | 18,542.4 ms | 356.50 ms| 410.55 ms|107000.0000|57000.0000|21000.0000| 409.16 MB  |

## Observations

1. **Performance**:
    - The time taken to process entries scales linearly with the number of entries.
    - Each third-party call adds a consistent delay, but overall time isn't purely a multiplier of this delay.

2. **Memory**:
    - Memory allocation grows significantly with the increase in the number of entries. This suggests memory use scales with the data size.

3. **Batching**:
    - Processing in batches aids in optimizing the processing time. It strikes a balance between parallelism and potential system or third-party overload.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Batch Efficiency**: The use of batching helps manage system resources and prevents potential overloads, showcasing its importance in large-scale operations.
   
2. **Memory Growth**: As operations scale, memory usage grows, emphasizing the need for efficient memory management in larger operations.

3. **Error Tolerance**: The system is designed to be resilient, continuing processing even when individual entries fail, a crucial feature for large datasets.

### Further Improvements

1. **Optimize Third-party Calls**: Any optimization in the third-party service can directly enhance the application's performance.

2. **Monitor Memory**: As operations scale, keep an eye on memory usage, and consider strategies to reduce allocation or optimize garbage collection.

3. **Balanced Parallelism**: Ensure the right level of concurrency for the system and the third-party service. Too much or too little can affect performance.

**In conclusion**, batch processing combined with asynchronous programming can efficiently handle large datasets. However, memory management and optimal concurrency levels are key to scaling operations effectively.
